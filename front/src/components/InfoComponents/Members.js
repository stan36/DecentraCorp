        Members of DecentraCorp:
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
          In a traditional DAO structure the members are the people who hold it's CryptoCurrency. Due
          the structure of the CryptoPatent Blockchain this will not work for DecentraCorp.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          While future projects tokens may grant their holders the ability to vote in DecentraCorp matters
          only members of the CryptoPatent Blockchain will have any voting power. Members of the
          CryptoPatent Blockchain are people who have either contributed an idea to the CryptoPatent
          Blockchain or a person who has staked a replication wallet with IdeaCoin.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is done to ensure a relatively high stake in the company before one is granted a say in it's
          workings.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be a six month period during which memberships will be availible for purchase through the DecentraCorp smart-contract.
          All funds raised during this period from membership purchases are put under control of the DecentraCorp contract which will be used to fund DecentraCorp Facilities
          and projects after a community vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a DAC DecentraCorp relies solely on the consensus of its members for the decisions it makes. This is done through a community wide vote.
          There is no board of directors nor are there stake holders to answer to. The Members of DecentraCorp fill both of these rolls as they are the ones
          most invested in the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          While filling the roll of the people leading the company members also must fill the roll of its employees. The voting power an individual member has
          is dependant upon both their member level AND their Facilities Rank. The only way to increase either is to invent ideas for,
          or replicate ideas on the CryptoPatent Blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ensures that the people who have worked the hardest for DecentraCorp have the most say.
