        The Decentralized Facilities Model:
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <div>
          <p>
          The DecentraCorp Decentralized Facility Model is a first of it's kind corporate structure where
    privately owned and run facilities cooperate towards the betterment of themselves and DecentraCorp as
    a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
     With the ideas stored on the CryptoPatent Blockchain anyone looking to start their own
    DecentraCorp Facility can freely do so with minimal start up capital. There is no one to “seek
    permission from” as there is no one “in charge”. There is no “right way” to do it.
    DecentraCorp relies on it's Decentralized Facilities model to allow anyone to start their own
    Facility and begin earning income anyway they can.
  </p>
  <p>
    DecentraCorp is designed to give anyone who is
    willing the tools and methods to start making a living where they are their own boss.
    Anyplace you can solder some wires, fit a 3D printer, or set up a computer3 can be turned
    into a DecentraCorp facility. Garages, sheds, car-ports, spare bedrooms, and even walk in closets can
    be turned into DecentraCorp facilities where they can begin making their operators income.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a decentralized facility a DecentraCorp member can begin producing replications of an
    idea patented to the CryptoPatent BlockChain. They can then sell/barter with/ or even give away the
    replications to others knowing that at the very least they will make an income on the IdeaCoin that their
    replication produces (mining replications require a stake in IdeaCoin to activate).
  </p>
  <p>
    DecentraCorp provides a new way for entrepreneurs and young inventors to start their own
    facilities both to fund themselves and their research. If done in combination with the DecentraCorp
    outreach program a DecentraCorp facility can be used to facilitate a non profit co-op or even an out-
    right charitable organization.
