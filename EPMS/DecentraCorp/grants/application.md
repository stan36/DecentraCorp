# Aragon Nest Proposal: DecentraCorp

## Abstract

DecentraCorp is the world's first Decentralized Autonomous Corporation
where the CEO’s and shareholders are the same people who build and maintain
the machinery.

DecentraCorp’s goal is to empower the individual
with the tools and technology to build a better world!

To reach this goal, DecentraCorp will employ the use of
Distributed Ledger Technologies, starting with IPFS and
smart-contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(both on and off the Ethereum Mainnet).

Utilizing these technologies and more,
DecentraCorp aims to provide the open source and
makers communities with a framework to help tinkerers and builders
earn a living for doing what they love while simultaneously helping to better their communities!

DecentraCorp relies heavily on its first project, The CryptoPatent Blockchain(In Alpha) to make all this possible. The CryptoPatent Blockchain is an open-source patent system which allows replications of any idea to mine IdeaCoin when they are used! The CryptoPatent Blockchain will exist on a second-layer Proof of Authority network anchored to the Main Ethereum Network.

A early Working Alpha of the project can be found at DecentraCorp.now.sh

## Deliverables

1.Further Development of the EPMS(Embedded Program Mining Software) Alpha Version
2.Further Development Of the Ethereum MainChain Based DecentraCorp Contracts using Aragon
3.Development of the Node.js based CrossChain Smart-Contract Relay
4.DecentraCorp Beta Project Deployment
5.Bug Bounty/Community Engagement Campaign
6.Project Launch!

## Grant size

Funding: Up to $100k in ETH, split into chunks paid out over achieved deliverables.

Success reward: Up to $50k in ANT, given out when all deliverables are ready.

## Application requirements

-$2000 upon application approval for the Acquisition of necessary equipment including a computer from this    decade and multiple raspberry pi's along with assorted parts.
-$16000 a month to cover the payroll expenses of five people for 6 months until the project is in its Beta release, at which point it should be capable of sustaining itself financially Via the onchain contracts membership sales.
-All remaining funds will be put towards the initial bank balance of the ChaosCasino!
-Organizational Structure: upon receipt of the Grant a team of up to five people will be hired on to further development of the project and carry it to completion! Positions being filled would include a react developer
a Python developer, and a PR manager. Upon completion of the Projects Beta Phase, project development will transition to fully open source! DecentraCorp operates as a meritocracy where an individual is judged by what they have contributed to the community!
