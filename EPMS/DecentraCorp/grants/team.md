### Christopher Dixon â€” Project Lead

I am the founder of DecentraCorp and inventor of the CryptoPatent Blockchain and the ChaosCasino. I had the Idea for DecentraCorp and the CryptoPatent Blockchain At the End of October 2017. In the last year I have done side work in everything from car and phone repair, to plumbing and electrical work. In between being a full time parent and my side work, I've spent the last year learning the programming tools necessary to build DecentraCorp to where it is today! During this last year I also worked as the Lead Solidity Developer on a CryptoCurrency Marketplace known as Forra.io. After helping them complete their MVP I began working full time on DecentraCorp (Which up until this point i had been working on part time).

Over this last Year i have dedicated my life to building DecentraCorp and learning all that i have because i truly believe DecentraCorp has the potential to fundamentally change the way the world works!
